              Hi there! My name is Roku and welcome to my learning journal.
            </h1>
            <p>
              After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career
              Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert
              code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded
              peers.

          How I stay committed to learning I like to think of myself as a
          lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try
          to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques
          into existing projects. While that was fun, I felt like it would be
          helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey
          with the world. How I got started I started simple and gradually grew
          my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was
          learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only
          reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I
          learned using my own words. That helped me grok what I was learning,
          and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping
          others learn and stay motivated.
